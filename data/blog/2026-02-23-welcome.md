## Why a Blog?

The NC Elections Transparency Project is about making voter data accessible. This blog extends that mission by providing context and analysis alongside the raw numbers.

Here you'll find three types of content:

**Analysis** -- data updates, deep dives into voter registration patterns, demographic shifts, and county-level trends drawn from NC State Board of Elections data.

**Research** -- explorations of academic and policy research relevant to NC elections, voter access, electoral integrity, and voters themselves.

**News** -- updates on the project, new features, and noteworthy developments in NC election administration.

## What's Coming

We're currently working on several pieces examining registration trends ahead of the 2026 election. Stay tuned.
